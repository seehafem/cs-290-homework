      <p id = "catering">We are available for catering with at least one month's notice.
      Rates are on a sliding scale, so you should contact us and discuss
      your needs and your vision to determine the actual rate. <br /><br />
      We do provide tastings for weddings, but we do charge $20 for a tasting.
      This will get you a chance to try three flavors of your choice and
      get a sense of what the appearance will be like. We also do custom
      designs that we can discuss further if you call, email, or simply
      come into our humble little shop. We hope to see you soon! Take care!</p>
