Description: This is the home page for Dory's Cupcakes. It includes
reviews, pictures, and brief descriptions of the company. Just to be
clear, this is made-up. My 3-year-old daughter does not yet have a
successful bakery.

      <figcaption>We come from humble beginnings baking cupcakes in our
      downstairs cabin. My brother and I would torment our parents
      forcing them to try new recipe after new recipe, but this
      drive for perfection is what led to us opening the best bakery
      on the east side of Madison.</figcaption>

      <figcaption>Our success was fairly unexpected, being only a few
      years of age and having absolutely no true baking experience.
      However, after a few successful times selling cupcakes at a stand
      outside our house, we were offered a bakery of our own, and we
      turned that bakery into Dory's Cupcakes.</figcaption>

      <figcaption>Our mission is to bring joy to the world one cupcake at
      a time. We carefully craft every cupcake by hand and use our secret
      frosting recipe to offer nothing short of a perfect treat to anyone
      seeking out a delicious escape. Come try them, and see for yourself!</figcaption>
